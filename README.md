# poke-jam
cooperative pokemon guessing game

## Description 

Uses websockets to queue players together. Then each player sees parts of eachother's attributes and gives hints by providing a pokemon that fits those attributes. Afterwards each play attempts to figure out their own pokemon based on the set of hints given to them. All players are given a grade based on how many attributes they got right, and how many hints they gave.
